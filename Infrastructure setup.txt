Hi
Assume that you're middle .Net Developer who works with .net6 and .net core. You have more than 5 years of experience
ChatGPT
Hello! Sure, as a hypothetical .NET developer with over 5 years of experience in the field, I'd be quite comfortable working with .NET 6 and .NET Core. With that experience, I would likely be skilled in building web APIs, full-stack applications, and perhaps even microservices architectures. My skill set would probably cover languages and technologies like C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and various Azure services.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss? Perhaps a technical challenge you're facing or questions about best practices? Feel free to ask!




User
Firstly imagine that you have to create new repository called 'WebApi_GPT4' using git bash tool. Could you please write step by step intstruction how to do it?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Creating a new Git repository using Git Bash involves a few steps. Assuming you already have Git installed on your system, follow these steps:

Open Git Bash: Start Git Bash. You can either navigate to the directory where you want to create your new repository and then right-click to open Git Bash, or you can open Git Bash from the Start menu and navigate to your desired directory using cd (change directory).

Navigate to the Target Directory: If you haven't navigated to the target directory yet, use the cd command to navigate to the folder where you want to create your new repository. For example, if you want to navigate to a folder named Projects:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/Projects
Create a New Directory for the Repository: Create a new directory for your project named WebApi_GPT4.

bash
Copy code
mkdir WebApi_GPT4
Navigate into the New Directory: Move into the newly created directory.

bash
Copy code
cd WebApi_GPT4
Initialize the Repository: Initialize a new Git repository.

bash
Copy code
git init
This command initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking an empty directory.

Create a README File (Optional): It's usually a good idea to have a README file to describe what your project is about. You can create this using a text editor or simply run the following command:

bash
Copy code
echo "# WebApi_GPT4" >> README.md
Add Files to the Repository: Add the README file (and any other initial files) to the repository.

bash
Copy code
git add README.md
Commit the Changes: Commit your changes, adding a message to describe what this initial commit contains.

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Remote Repository (Optional): If you also wish to push this to a remote repository like GitHub, you'll need to create a new repository there and link it. After creating the repository on GitHub, you can add the remote repository like so:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/WebApi_GPT4.git
Push to Remote (Optional): Push your local commits to the remote repository.

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
And that's it! You've initialized a local Git repository, added an initial file, and committed your changes. Optionally, you've also linked it to a remote repository.




User
After I ran command from step 9 - I got error that error: remote origin already exists..
But when I run step 10  I go following errors:
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/antadriana/WebApi_GPT4.git/' not found

what should I do to fix it?
ChatGPT
The error "remote origin already exists" suggests that the local repository already has a remote repository associated with it named "origin". The "Repository not found" error indicates that Git can't find the remote repository at the URL you've specified.

Here's how you can address these issues:

Error: remote origin already exists
If a remote repository is already linked, you can either update the existing origin or use a different name for the new remote repository.

Update existing origin: To change the existing 'origin' URL, you can do:

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YourUsername/WebApi_GPT4.git
Or add a new remote with a different name: If you want to keep the existing 'origin' and add another remote, you can add it under a different name:

bash
Copy code
git remote add new_origin https://github.com/YourUsername/WebApi_GPT4.git
After doing this, you would push using the new name:

bash
Copy code
git push -u new_origin master
Error: Repository not found
For the "Repository not found" error, make sure that:

The GitHub repository actually exists and that you have access to it.
Your username is correct and you're using the correct URL for the repository.
If the repository is private, ensure that the GitHub credentials stored on your computer are current. You may need to update the stored credentials or generate a new personal access token.
After resolving these issues, you should be able to successfully push your local changes to the remote repository.




User
Tell me please how to connect to existing repo using GitBash
ChatGPT
To connect to an existing remote repository using Git Bash, you'll typically "clone" that repository to create a copy on your local machine, or you'll "add" the remote repository URL to an existing local repository. Here's how to do both:

Cloning an Existing Repository
If you don't have a copy of the repository on your local machine, you can clone it using the git clone command:

Open Git Bash: Start Git Bash and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/folder
Clone the Repository: Run the git clone command followed by the repository URL.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ExistingRepo.git
This will create a folder named ExistingRepo containing all the files from the remote repository.

Adding Remote to an Existing Local Repository
If you already have a local repository and want to connect it to a remote repository, you can use the git remote add command:

Navigate to Local Repository: Use Git Bash to navigate to your local repository.

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/local/repo
Initialize Git (If Not Already): If your folder is not yet a Git repository, initialize it.

bash
Copy code
git init
Add Remote Repository: Add the remote repository using the git remote add command. Replace origin with the name you'd like to give to the remote repository, and replace the URL with the repository's URL.

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/ExistingRepo.git
Verify Remote Repository: To make sure that the remote repository has been added correctly, you can run:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
This will show you the URLs of remote repositories that are connected to your local repository.

Fetch Data: To fetch data from the remote repository to your local repository, you can run:

bash
Copy code
git fetch origin
Pull Data: To update your local repository with the data from the remote, you can run:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin master
Replace master with the branch name if you are working with a different branch.

Push Data: To push your local changes to the remote repository, run:

bash
Copy code
git push origin master
By following these steps, you should be able to either clone an existing repository or connect an existing local repository to a remote one using Git Bash.




User
Now assume that you have to bind SonarCloud.io to repository. It's link to that repo https://github.com/antadriana/WebApi_GPT.
Could you please give me steps how to do it?
ChatGPT
Certainly, integrating SonarCloud with a GitHub repository involves a number of steps, from setting up the SonarCloud account to configuring your CI/CD pipeline for analysis. Here's a general guideline on how you could do it:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have an account on SonarCloud.io.
Make sure you have admin access to the GitHub repository.
Steps to Bind SonarCloud with GitHub Repository
Log in to SonarCloud: Sign in to your SonarCloud account.

Connect with GitHub: If you haven’t already connected SonarCloud to your GitHub account, you'll need to do this first. Usually, this involves granting SonarCloud permission to access your repositories on GitHub.

Import Project:

On the SonarCloud dashboard, you may have the option to + Add new project.
Choose GitHub as the repository provider.
You will see a list of all GitHub repositories you have access to. Find and select antadriana/WebApi_GPT from the list to import it.
Configure Analysis:

After importing, you will be prompted to set up your analysis method. Choose the appropriate one (probably "Other" if you are using .NET Core).
You will get a sonar-project.properties file or commands to run. This configuration is crucial for running SonarCloud analysis.
Integrate with Your CI/CD: If you're using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or any other CI/CD tools, integrate SonarCloud scanning into your pipeline. This typically involves adding some commands to your CI/CD configuration. You will usually need to install the SonarScanner and then run the analysis using the sonar-scanner command or equivalent, depending on your CI/CD tool. Here's a sample snippet for GitHub Actions:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Build and analyze
  env:
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
    dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"YourProjectKey" /o:"YourOrganization" /d:sonar.login="${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}"
    dotnet build YourSolution.sln
    dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}"
Run Analysis: Trigger a build in your CI/CD pipeline. This should run the SonarCloud analysis as well. Once the build is complete, you should see the analysis results on the SonarCloud dashboard.

Verify Setup: Check SonarCloud to make sure that the code analysis is appearing as you expect.

Protect Your Branches (Optional): If you want, you can set up GitHub to only allow pull requests to be merged if the SonarCloud checks pass. This can be configured in the GitHub repository settings under the "Branches" tab by adding a branch protection rule.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up SonarCloud for your GitHub repository and start running analyses to maintain code quality.

How to trigger manualy GitHub Actions workflow.?
ChatGPT
Manually triggering a GitHub Actions workflow can be very useful for various scenarios such as testing, debugging, or simply running some one-off tasks. Here's how you can do it:

Method 1: Using GitHub UI
Navigate to Your Repository: Go to the GitHub repository where your workflow is defined.

Go to Actions: Click on the Actions tab to see a list of your workflow files.

Actions Tab

Select a Workflow: Click on the name of the workflow you want to run. If you have multiple workflows, they will be listed here.

Run Workflow Button: On the right-hand side, you'll find a Run workflow dropdown.

Run Workflow Button

Select Branch and Trigger: Choose the branch where the workflow is located, and if there are any additional input parameters, fill those in. Then click Run workflow.

Method 2: Using curl and GitHub API
If you want to trigger a workflow programmatically, you can use the GitHub API. You'll need a personal access token with repo and workflow permissions.

Here is a sample curl command to trigger a workflow manually:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO_NAME/actions/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID_OR_NAME/dispatches \
     -d '{"ref":"BRANCH_NAME_OR_TAG"}'
Replace YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN, OWNER, REPO_NAME, WORKFLOW_ID_OR_NAME, and BRANCH_NAME_OR_TAG with your personal access token, the owner of the repository, the repository name, the workflow ID or name, and the branch name or tag, respectively.

By using either of these methods, you can manually trigger a GitHub Actions workflow.




User
You got an error after creating workflow file as listed above in coversation
Invalid workflow file: .github/workflows/main.yml#L1
You have an error in your yaml syntax on line 1

what can be done to fix it?
ChatGPT
The YAML syntax error usually indicates that there's an issue with the formatting or structure of the YAML file. Here are some common mistakes that people make when writing YAML files for GitHub Actions:

Indentation: YAML files are sensitive to indentation. Make sure you are using spaces and not tabs, and the number of spaces is consistent for each level of indentation.

Colons and Spaces: Make sure that every key-value pair is separated by a colon and a space, e.g., key: value.

Hyphens for Lists: When specifying a list, use hyphens and make sure there's a space after the hyphen.

Quotes: Although not always necessary, it's good practice to wrap strings in quotes.

Check for Extraneous Characters: Make sure there are no extraneous characters or comments.

Let's revisit the line you've provided:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Run SonarCloud Analysis
  uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
The above code is a fragment that is intended to be part of a larger workflow file. If you directly copied this code to main.yml, it would be considered invalid because a complete GitHub Actions YAML file usually starts with a name and an on field to specify when the action should run.

Here's an example of how the snippet could fit into a complete GitHub Actions YAML file:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main  # replace with your default branch if it's not named "main"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Run SonarCloud Analysis
        uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
Copy and paste this complete example into your main.yml and modify as needed. Save the changes and commit the file to see if the error is resolved.




User
should this file be named 'main' or 'master'?
if my branch is master\
ChatGPT
The name of the GitHub Actions workflow file doesn't necessarily have to match the name of your branch. You can name the workflow file something descriptive, like ci-cd.yml or build.yml. This file should be placed in the .github/workflows/ directory in your repository.

However, the on section in the YAML file does specify which branches the workflow will run on. If your primary branch is called master, then you should configure it like this:

yaml
Copy code
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
This tells GitHub Actions to run the workflow whenever there's a push to the master branch.

Here's how it could look in context:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - master  # This should match your default or target branch name

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Run SonarCloud Analysis
        uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
So, to summarize:

The name of the GitHub Actions workflow file (main.yml, ci-cd.yml, etc.) is not tied to the branch name.
The branch that the workflow runs on is specified in the on section of the workflow file. Make sure this matches the name of your primary branch if you want the workflow to run on pushes to that branch.

ChatGPT
The log output indicates that mandatory properties sonar.projectKey and sonar.organization are missing. These properties are required to tell the SonarScanner which project and organization on SonarCloud it should associate the analysis with.

Here's how you can fix this:

GitHub Actions Configuration Changes
You can pass these properties directly within your GitHub Actions workflow file. You would typically do this in your .github/workflows/main.yml or equivalent workflow YAML file. Update the "Run SonarCloud Analysis" step like this:

yaml
Copy code
      - name: Run SonarCloud Analysis
        uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: >
            -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
            -Dsonar.organization=your_organization_key_here
Replace your_project_key_here and your_organization_key_here with the actual project and organization keys from your SonarCloud account.

Using sonar-project.properties
Alternatively, you can define these properties in a sonar-project.properties file at the root of your repository:

properties
Copy code
sonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
sonar.organization=your_organization_key_here
# other properties like sonar.sources if needed
After adding this file, commit it to your repository, and the next run should pick it up.

Debugging
If you encounter more issues, you can enable full debug logging by modifying the args like this:

yaml
Copy code
        with:
          args: >
            -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
            -Dsonar.organization=your_organization_key_here
            -X
This will give you more detailed logs that can help you figure out any remaining issues.




User
where can I get sonar_project_key and sonar_organization_key?
ChatGPT
The sonar.projectKey and sonar.organization keys are identifiers that help SonarCloud recognize your project and organization. Here's how to find or set them up:

Finding Your Organization Key:
Log into your SonarCloud account.
Go to "My Organizations" by clicking on the icon/avatar at the top-right corner.
Click on the relevant organization. The URL in your web browser should now include your organization key. The URL typically looks like: https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/<organization-key>/dashboard.
Finding/Setting up Your Project Key:
The project key is usually created when you initially set up a new project in SonarCloud.

Navigate to your Organization Dashboard: Follow the URL structure https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/<organization-key>/projects to go to the projects listing.
Create a New Project: If you haven't already created a project for your repository, you can do so here.
Existing Projects: If you have already set up a project, click on the project to navigate to its dashboard. The URL should look like https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=<project-key> where <project-key> is your project key.
Manual Configuration (Optional):
When creating a new project, you often have the opportunity to set the projectKey manually. It is good to follow SonarCloud's guidelines for a valid projectKey.

Setting Keys in GitHub Actions
After you have these keys, you can update your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file as described in my previous response.

yaml
Copy code
        with:
          args: >
            -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
            -Dsonar.organization=your_organization_key_here
Replace your_project_key_here and your_organization_key_here with the actual project and organization keys.

Remember to also store your SonarCloud token (SONAR_TOKEN) in your GitHub repository's secrets if you haven't already, as it is needed for authentication.

Certainly, based on the information you've provided, a simple GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to run SonarCloud analysis on your .NET project could look like this:

yaml
Copy code
name: .NET SonarCloud Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '6.0.x'  # adjust this to your project's .NET version

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore

    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

    - name: Run SonarCloud Analysis
      uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
      with:
        args: >
          -Dsonar.projectKey=antadriana_WebApi_GPT
          -Dsonar.organization=antadriana
Important Note:

You'll need to add your SonarCloud token (SONAR_TOKEN) to your GitHub repository's secrets, which you can do under your repository settings in the "Secrets" tab.
After adding this YAML file under .github/workflows/ in your repository and committing it to the master branch, GitHub Actions should automatically pick up this workflow and start running it on every push to master. Make sure that your SonarCloud token is stored as a secret in GitHub to allow the workflow to authenticate with SonarCloud.

Run dotnet restore
MSBUILD : error MSB1003: Specify a project or solution file. The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
ChatGPT
The error message MSBUILD : error MSB1003: Specify a project or solution file. The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file. indicates that the dotnet restore command could not find a .csproj or .sln file in the current working directory.

Here are a few ways to resolve the issue:

1. Specify the Path Explicitly:
If your .csproj or .sln file is not in the root directory of the repository, you can specify its location explicitly like so:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Restore dependencies
  run: dotnet restore path/to/your/project.sln
2. Change the Working Directory:
You can change the working directory for all subsequent steps in your job:

yaml
Copy code
jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: path/to/your/project
Or just for a single step:

yaml
Copy code
- name: Restore dependencies
  run: dotnet restore
  working-directory: path/to/your/project
3. Check Out the Code Correctly:
Make sure the actions/checkout@v2 step ran successfully. This step checks out your repository content, making it available for the subsequent steps in the GitHub Actions workflow.

Here's how the revised portion of your YAML file could look like, using method 1:

yaml
Copy code
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '6.0.x'  # adjust this to your project's .NET version

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore path/to/your/project.sln  # adjust the path

    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build path/to/your/project.sln --no-restore  # adjust the path

    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test path/to/your/project.sln --no-build --verbosity normal  # adjust the path
Remember to replace path/to/your/project.sln with the actual relative path to your .sln or .csproj file.

assume that you're devops with 10 years old experience 
You have a new .net project on github https://github.com/antadriana/WebApi_GPT
you need to bind it to free sonar cloud and create detaile step by step instruction and github worflow file
ChatGPT
Certainly, integrating SonarCloud into your GitHub repository for a .NET project involves a few steps, but it's straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide, followed by a sample GitHub Actions workflow YAML file.

Step-by-Step Guide to Bind a GitHub Project with SonarCloud
Step 1: Sign In to SonarCloud
Visit SonarCloud.io.
Click on "Log in" and sign in using your GitHub account.
Step 2: Create a New Organization
If you haven't created an organization yet, SonarCloud will prompt you to create one.
Choose a name for the organization and proceed.
Step 3: Add a New Project
Once the organization is set up, you'll be prompted to "Analyze New Project."
Select GitHub as the repository provider.
SonarCloud will display a list of available repositories. Choose WebApi_GPT and proceed.
Step 4: Configure Analysis
SonarCloud will generate a sonar-project.properties file. You don't necessarily need to add this to your repository for .NET, but keep a note of the sonar.projectKey and sonar.organization as you'll need these.
Step 5: Add GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository https://github.com/antadriana/WebApi_GPT, then to Settings > Secrets.
Add a new secret called SONAR_TOKEN and paste the token generated from SonarCloud.
Step 6: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a new file under .github/workflows in your repository.
Name the file sonarcloud-analysis.yml or something similar.
Add the following YAML configuration to it, replacing your_project_key_here and your_organization_key_here with the project and organization keys noted earlier.
yaml
Copy code
name: SonarCloud Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  SonarCloud:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup .NET SDK
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '6.0.x'  # adjust this to your project's .NET version

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore

    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release

    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal

    - name: SonarCloud Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
      with:
        args: >
          -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
          -Dsonar.organization=your_organization_key_here
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
Step 7: Push to GitHub
Commit and push this file to your master branch.
Step 8: Monitor SonarCloud
Once GitHub Actions run successfully, check your SonarCloud dashboard for analysis results.
Step 9: Test
Make a trivial change in your code and push to the master branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. You should see a new analysis on your SonarCloud dashboard.

And there you have it! This will set up SonarCloud analysis with GitHub Actions for your .NET project.

code above raise such errorMSBUILD : error MSB1003: Specify a project or solution file. The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
ChatGPT
If you're getting the error message MSBUILD : error MSB1003: Specify a project or solution file. The current working directory does not contain a project or solution file, it usually means that the GitHub Action runner is in a directory where it can't find a .csproj or .sln file to execute the dotnet commands on.

Here's how you can debug and fix this:

Debugging Steps
Check the Repository: Make sure that your .csproj or .sln files are checked into the repository at the location you expect.

Explicit Path: If your .csproj or .sln files are in a sub-folder and not in the root directory, you need to specify their path in your GitHub Actions YAML file when running dotnet commands.

Updated GitHub Actions YAML
Here is an updated version of the previous YAML file that assumes your .sln file is in a folder called YourSolutionFolder. Replace YourSolutionFolder with the actual folder name where your .sln file resides.

yaml
Copy code
name: SonarCloud Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  SonarCloud:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup .NET SDK
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
      with:
        dotnet-version: '6.0.x'  # adjust this to your project's .NET version

    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln  # replace 'YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln' with the relative path to your .sln file

    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln --no-restore --configuration Release  # replace 'YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln' with the relative path to your .sln file

    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln --no-build --verbosity normal  # replace 'YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln' with the relative path to your .sln file

    - name: SonarCloud Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
      with:
        args: >
          -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key_here
          -Dsonar.organization=your_organization_key_here
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
Remember to replace YourSolutionFolder/YourProject.sln with the correct relative path to your .sln file from the root directory of your GitHub repository. The same applies to .csproj files if you are using them instead of a .sln file.
